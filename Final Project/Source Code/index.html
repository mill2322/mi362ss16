                <h2>About Me </h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Kevin Miller and I am graduating from Michigan State University (MSU) with a B.S.
                in Computer Science and Engineering and a cognate in Media and Information. My education at MSU has encouraged me to
                pursue many fields of computer science including software engineering, web design and development, web and mobile application
                development, and cyber security. I have worked extensively with common programming languages like Java, C/C++, Python, HTML, CSS,
                PHP, and JavaScript. I am searching for a career that will utilize my skillset while challenging me to continue improving and learning about
                computer science.</p>
				<p>On this website you will find more detailed information on an undergraduate research opportunity I participated in, as well as additional
				information about extracurricular activities that I have been involved with throughout my experience at MSU. If you would like a copy of my
				resume or are interested in hearing more, please navigate to the contact page to view my contact information.</p>
