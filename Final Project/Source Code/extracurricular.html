        <h2 id="music">Music</h2>  
            <p>I’ve always admired musicians for their effortless creativity. The way people are able to evoke an emotion or construct an 
			atmosphere with sound alone has held my interest for as long as I can remember. In middle school, I started taking drumming 
			lessons after school. It was during these lessons that I not only learned the fundamentals of music, but also developed 
			my understanding of effective collaboration. Drums are used to lay the foundation of a song by establishing the rhythm
			and tempo. After years of playing the drums, I decided I wanted to explore other instruments becasue I love opportunities to be inventive. 
			In high school, I taught myself how to play 
			the guitar and piano by watching youtube videos, and eventually started composing my own songs. </p>
			<p>In the past, I would
			play music in my parents basement, and when I moved to the dorms at Michigan State University, I 
			invited people on my floor to play music with me outside in the grass. My senior year of university, 
			two of my friends and I were invited to play at a campus event called Spartahack. Being on stage in front of a live audience
			is a crazy experience, but one I am glad that I had. All of these experiences have helped me understand how to relate and engage with other people
			and these skills have carried through to presenting my research projects in a clear and entertaining 
			way. In college, I’ve continued to play the drums in a worship band at my Church every other Sunday morning, and
			I found time to record some original songs which you can listen to below!</p>
