        <h2 id="music">Music</h2>  
            <p>I’ve always admired musicians for their effortless creativity. The way people are able to evoke an emotion or construct an 
			atmosphere with sound alone has held my interest for as long as I can remember. In middle school, I started taking drumming 
			lessons after school. It was during these lessons that I not only learned the fundamentals of music, but also developed 
			my understanding of effective collaboration. Drums are used to lay the foundation of a song by establishing the rhythm
			and tempo. After years of playing the drums, I decided I wanted to explore other instruments becasue I love opportunities to be inventive. 
			In high school, I taught myself how to play 
			the guitar and piano by watching youtube videos, and eventually started composing my own songs. </p>
			<p>In the past, I would
			play music in my parents basement, and when I moved to the dorms at Michigan State University, I 
			invited people on my floor to play music with me outside in the grass. My senior year of university, 
			two of my friends and I were invited to play at a campus event called Spartahack. Being on stage in front of a live audience
			is a crazy experience, but one I am glad that I had. All of these experiences have helped me understand how to relate and engage with other people
			and these skills have carried through to presenting my research projects in a clear and entertaining 
			way. In college, I’ve continued to play the drums in a worship band at my Church every other Sunday morning, and
			I found time to record some original songs which you can listen to below!</p>

        <h2 id="camping">Camping</h2>
		<p>I love traveling to new places and experiencing new things. I believe spending time outdoors is essential to really enjoy life to its fullest.
		While it would be nice to travel where ever I'd like, it can be quite expensive. A great alternative to this, and one of my favorite hobbies, is camping!
		I've found spending time outdoors, pitching a tent, going fishing, making a bonfire with friends, and eating some smores is very refreshing for my mind. I
		now try to balance my life in computer science with time in the sun!</p>
		
        <h3>Wildwood ranch camp counselor</h3>
            <p>One of my favorite experiences outdoors was as a counselor and cook at a summer camp called Wildwood ranch. I worked there for two summers and really enjoyed
			working with dozens of other counselors to help facilitate team building exercises for the inner city youth that would come to the camp. I learned a lot about
			leadership and teamwork at Wildwood as it is a high stress environment with very little rest. We often were supporting and relying on each other to work through the weeks
			which grew us together. Some of the most rewarding moments were when the urban youth would see stars for the first time (its too bright in the city) or learn about
			wild edible plants. My experience here not only improved my outlook on spending time outside, but it helped me understand the skills needed for communicating with a team
			in a high stress environment.</p>
